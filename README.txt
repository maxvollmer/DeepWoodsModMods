Example mods that use the DeepWoodsModAPI (https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaxVollmer.StardewValley.DeepWoodsMod.API/) to modify the DeepWoodsMod forest:

The main purpose of these example mods is to serve as guideline/tutorial for modders who want to create their own mods for DeepWoods. Even though some of these might be useful for actual players, be aware that I don't provide any gameplay support for these, meaning I will not respond to bug reports from players related to these example mods.

Modders: Feel free to use the code in these examples as basis for your own mods!


[DW]EvenMoreDeepWoods:
* Adds seasonal foragables to normal forest levels.
* Adds fiddlehead fern to forest levels in summer.
* Adds seasonal extras to clearings:
** Winter tree and presents in winter.
** Giant pumpkins and spooky decoration in fall.
** Flower fields and bee houses with honey in spring and summer.

[DW]LowPerformanceOptimizer:
* Removes baubles and weatherdebris.
* Reduces amount of grass by a given percentage.

[DW]EverythingIsAClearing:
* Simply turns every DeepWoods level into a clearing.

[DW]ExampleCustomLevel:
* Replaces every second DeepWoods level with a custom level.

[DW]NeverGetLost:
* Disables getting lost. (Careful: This keeps all levels in memory until the entire forest is reset during a game save/load event. Rushing through a lot of levels will consume a lot of memory.)


EvenMoreDeepWoods and LowPerformanceOptimizer are available as prebuild versions on the DeepWoodsMod page on nexusmods (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2571), due to their potential usefulness for normal players.
